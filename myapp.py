<h1>monkeys</h1>
<body><h2 style="color:black;"> monkeys are naughty creatures, who love to play around and terrorize people and other animals! <br>

    Did you know that a monkey is a primate and they belong to the suborder of Haplorhines?
    
    Now that’s a big word to get your head around! 
    There are around 260 monkey species in the world. Most of them live in trees except for a few who seem to prefer the ground like baboons.

    In general, monkeys are thought of as highly intelligent animals.<br>
    
    Do you think they’re as clever as us? Here are some facts about the different species of monkey.
    
    Most species of monkeys have tails except for the mighty ape. There are around 260 monkey species in the world. Most of them live in trees except for a few who seem to prefer the ground like baboons.
    
    There are a few characteristics that are shared by most species.<br> For example there are New World Monkeys and Old World monkeys.
    
    New World monkeys have tails that can grasp and hold things, but Old World monkeys don’t have this.
    
    That’s pretty cool having such a strong and handy tail!

    It’s quite easy to see the difference between Old World and New World monkeys just by their faces, which look rather different from each other.
    
    The only things that are similar are their noses, cheeks and forward facing eyes.
    
    Old World monkeys are found in Africa and New World monkeys are found in South America.
    
    Apes are sometimes mistaken for monkeys but they actually aren’t monkeys.

    <h1>snakes</h1>
    <h2>Snakes are reptiles. They are part of the order Squamata. They are carnivores, with long narrow bodies and no legs. There are at least 20 families, about 500 genera and 3,400 species of snake.

        The earliest known fossils are from the Jurassic period. This was between 143 and 167 million years ago.
        
        Their long, slender body has some special features. They have overlapping scales which protect them, and help them move and climb trees. The scales have colours which may be camouflage or warning colours.
        
        Many species have skulls with more joints than the skulls of their lizard ancestors. This allows the snakes to swallow prey much larger than their heads. In their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side.<br> Most have only one working lung. Some species have kept a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. They have no eyelids or external ears. They can hiss, but otherwise make no vocal sounds.
        
        They are very mobile in their own way. Most of them live in the tropics. Few snake species live beyond the Tropic of Cancer or Tropic of Capricorn, and only one species, the common viper (Vipera berus) lives beyond the Arctic Circle. They can see well enough, and they can taste scents with their tongues by flicking them in and out. They are very sensitive to vibrations in the ground.<br> Some snakes can sense warm-blooded animals by thermal infrared.
        
        Most snakes live on the ground, and in the trees. Others live in the water, and a few live under the soil. Like other reptiles, snakes are ectotherms. They control their body temperature by moving in and out of the direct sunshine. That is why they are rare in cold places.
        
        Snakes range in size from the tiny, 10.4 cm (4 inch)-long thread snake to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters (22.8 ft) in length. The extinct snake Titanoboa was 12.8 meters (42 ft) long.
